A basic GitHub repository for ou Sustainability Website [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) project.It addresses the overall climate change in different spheres of life.


### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms to do more social work and show to the world what each one of them can do. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well. This website will guid them all sections of the society and reward them for each work they do.

### The idea

The idea is to give rewards for each social work a person does with prove. In this way we can spread positivity and come up with a solution to uplift some sections of the society.
